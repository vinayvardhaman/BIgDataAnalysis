NEW YORK —  Wall Street has been much more excited about the system underpinning bitcoin than the cryptocurrency itself, but the global financial industry has not yet been able to do much with the technology known as blockchain.Reuters has found several blockchain projects launched by major financial institutions that have been shelved, as development of the technology enters a hype-meets-reality phase.The casualties include projects by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), BNP Paribas SA and SIX Group, Reuters has found.These were among the wave of blockchain tests touted by the financial industry over the past few years, as firms bet the new technology would displace much of the sector's infrastructure, cutting out middlemen, speeding transactions and reducing costs for things like securities and payments processing.Yet as some projects were developed, companies pulled back for various reasons - from costs to industry readiness, underscoring that, for all its potential, blockchain is still in its early days.DTCC, known as Wall Street's bookkeeper, recently put the brakes on a blockchain system for the clearing and settlement of repurchase, or repo, agreement transactions, said Murray Pozmanter, head of clearing agency services at the DTCC.The project, which had successfully tested with startup Digital Asset Holdings (DA), was shelved because banks and other potential users believed the same results could be achieved more cheaply using current technology, he said."Basically, it became a solution in search of a problem," he said.Post-trade services provider, SIX Securities Services, a unit of the group that operates Switzerland's stock exchange, has also decided not take into production a prototype built by DA for the processing of securities, SIX spokesman Jürg Schneider, told Reuters."We wanted to go into another direction," Schneider said.The partnership with DA, run by former JPMorgan Chase & Co executive Blythe Masters, was announced in 2016.French bank BNP Paribas in 2016 said its securities services division had partnered with startups including SmartAngels to build a platform for private small businesses to manage their securities.The bank stopped work on the project, and will instead team up with other financial institutions on another blockchain initiative called LiquidShare, said a source familiar with the matter. "Creating an enterprise-wide robust blockchain platform requires the full cooperation of the whole post trade ecosystem," the source said.PROOFS OF CONCEPTThe DTCC, BNP Paribas and SIX tests were among a barrage of blockchain "proofs of concept" announced with great fanfare by financial institutions."A large part of the problem has been expectation management, or rather lack thereof by many vendors and large consultancies that made claims that could not be fulfilled in the time spans they had said on stage at fintech events," said Tim Swanson, founder of technology advisory Post Oak Labs.Reuters reported last week JPMorgan was considering spinning off its marquee blockchain project Quorum. In July a partnership between settlement provider Euroclear and startup Paxos to develop a blockchain service was dissolved.Still, other projects are moving forward.Pozmanter said the DTCC is still examining another project with DA and that it is close to testing a blockchain-based trade information warehouse set to launch next year."We're still bullish on the technology," Pozmanter said.The repo test with DA "met all its stated goals" and led to a new project that DTCC is examining, said DA spokeswoman Vera Newhouse.SIX is working on a blockchain project with Nasdaq  and Australia's stock exchange ASX Ltd said in December that DA will help replace its registry, settlement and clearing system, in one of the most ambitious projects to receive a green light.(Reporting by John McCrank and Anna Irrera; Editing by Nick Zieminski)NEW YORK —  JPMorgan Chase & Co is considering a spin-off of its marquee blockchain project Quorum believing independence from the bank could increase the platform's appeal, sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.Blockchain first emerged as the software underpinning cryptocurrencies but is being adapted to build a variety of business applications. Quorum is already open source, meaning its code is free and may be modified and redistributed.Discussions were still in the early days, one of the sources said.The plans were first reported by the Financial Times."We continue to believe distributed ledger technology will play a transformative role in business which is why we are actively building multiple blockchain solutions," the bank said in a statement."We're not going to comment on speculation, but Quorum has become an extremely successful enterprise platform even beyond financial services and we’re excited about its potential."Quorum is among a swathe of initiatives by large banks on blockchain.Banks have been spending millions of dollars on the technology in the hopes that it can help them slash costs and simplify some of their processes, ranging from international payments to the settlement of securities trades.Yet the technology is still in its early days and projects have faced some growing pains.JPMorgan was among the banks that left blockchain consortium R3 last year, while a partnership between Belgium-based settlement provider Euroclear and U.S. startup Paxos to develop a blockchain-based service for the London gold market was dissolved in July.It remains unclear what the spin-off plans would mean for the JPMorgan employees that have been working on Quorum and whether they would join the new entity, one of the sources said.Product development for Quorum has been led by Amber Baldet, an executive director of the bank's Blockchain Center of Excellence. Baldet could decide leave the firm and start a new venture, join the spun-off entity or stay at the bank, the source said. Baldet did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The bank had built Quorum internally using the Ethereum network, one of the most popular public blockchains. The initiative was seen as a noteworthy endorsement to Ethereum, the blockchain behind cryptocurrency ether.JPMorgan announced in October that it would be using Quorum to build an interbank payments platform alongside Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd and the Royal Bank of Canada.(Reporting by Anna Irrera; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)TORONTO —  Goldcorp Inc made the first gold deposit on Tradewind Markets' new digitized trading platform, the companies said on Thursday, with 3,000 ounces of bullion from its Red Lake mine complex in Ontario.As old-school gold trading increasingly moves into the digital era, the deposit represents a "milestone" as the genesis block, or first step in the blockchain on Tradewind's newly launched VaultChain, the companies said."The combination of blockchain and gold is really the first way for investors to directly own gold in a financial instrument with no ongoing administration and storage costs...that eat away at the value of the gold that you own," Goldcorp vice president, David Stephens, told Reuters."We think that can have a big impact on the institutional market for gold investment."New York-based Tradewind uses blockchain, a tamper-proof shared ledger that can automatically process and settle transactions using computer algorithms, as part of a system tailored to precious metals that securely identifies participants, registers gold and settles transactions.Financially backed and spun off from U.S. stock exchange operator IEX Group, Tradewind says the current gold market takes too long to settle trades, gives an opaque ownership record and has potential for errors that require manual reconciliation.Other gold blockchain services for trade and supply chain tracking have been developed, including the recent partnership of California's Emergent Technology Holdings with Canadian miner Yamana Gold.Goldcorp said its deposit is the first to use blockchain in the recording and managing of gold in an institution. The Vancouver-based company said it will use VaultChain to directly sell gold to dealers and banks and work with Tradewind to add new services."There's now a base from which gold is digitized and that creates all kinds of opportunities for increases in the usage of gold," Stephens said. "Anything that gives gold more utility has to be beneficial for the price."Tradewind, whose investors include Goldcorp and investment firm Sprott Inc, will store gold at the Royal Canadian Mint."We believe that our technology will enable gold producers like Goldcorp to overcome existing limitations and move into the electronic age," said Tradewind President Matt Trudeau in a statement.Blockchain is currently used in the diamond industry and planned for cobalt mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo.Diamonds get digital fingerprints that are tracked by blockchain as gems are sold, providing a forgery-proof record of the gems' origin.(Reporting by Susan Taylor; Editing by Bernadette Baum)FRANKFURT —  European utilities plan to begin some direct trades with one another using blockchain technology within months, hoping to stay ahead in a world in which individuals may eventually sell green energy to one another.The distributed ledger technology that underpins the bitcoin currency has already been tested by energy operators for wholesale trading, but it will go live with just a few selected electricity and gas contracts to start with.The initiative, Enerchain, is a forerunner of more possible uses of the technology by established energy players and wider options explored by a raft of start-ups to harness its potential - many of them years away from execution.Regulators are seeking to control this strategic sector to avoid security issues, digital infrastructure is lagging and players must agree to share data and avoid privacy breaches.While tentative, Enerchain is a test of the utilities' ability to protect their margins by dominating novel automated trading architectures matching energy producers with each other and also with users.Apart from staving off competition from more agile digital companies, it could help speed a sector shift in Germany from fossil fuels to renewables, bypassing nuclear, highlighted in a reorganisation of E.ON and RWE this month.German IT company Ponton has worked with 39 power and gas traders to build the peer-to-peer platform since 2016.Managing director Michael Merz told Reuters its members will choose contracts to go live with as soon as they set up a legal entity to pool budgets, probably in the second or third quarter of 2018, his first detailed comments on the timeline to mainstream media.The companies, which include prominent names such as Italy's Enel, Germany's E.ON and Sweden's Vattenfall, were driven by the need to lower transaction costs in an era of growing competition and energy supplies, he said."Publishing orders and transactions via blockchain can replace trading via brokers," Merz said. "We have developed an order execution process that works just like a typical OTC (over-the-counter) market front end."COOPERATION AND COMPETITIONAlongside brokers, potential losers from the Enerchain proposition include exchanges such as ICE or EEX, but both are joining the blockchain party.ICE in January launched a cryptocurrency data feed in January and both it and EEX are discussing applications with customers and tech firms."We see this new technology as a real opportunity to further improve our business," EEX chief executive Peter Reitz said during the E-World of Energy trade fair last month.Instead of administering duplicate databases, blockchain comprises one record maintained by a network of participants rather than a centralised entity: accessible and unchangeable.Ponton would not monopolise Enerchain software, Metz said, but step back to develop other products, to simplify peer-to-peer grid processes and speed north Germany's green power supply.Vattenfall business development manager Kilian Leykam said while Enerchain was still in test phase, "...we are confident that we will see live trades this year when all necessary technical and regulatory prerequisites are fulfilled."Germany's regulator the Bundesnetzagentur said it keeps a tight watch over networks and retail markets where suppliers are licensed and monitored regardless of the technology they use.Matthias Lang, an energy specialist at law firm Bird & Bird, said this creates high entrance hurdles which software developers should build into their processes from the start."I have to clarify in practice, that I can only sell energy when I've got some, and what happens at other times," he said. "Two or more suppliers must club together and someone has to control that."Austrian utility Wien Energie, also part of the Enerchain initiative, has been testing blockchain for settling gas trades via the platform of Canadian start-up BTL, co-operating with the likes of ENI and BP since 2017.Vattenfall also participates in that test consortium, called BTL One Office, which is more focused on trade settlements, and is also close to revealing further progress.Energy shipments often involve lengthy chains of documents and multiple acknowledgement receipts. Even electronic platforms with central clearing functions can be slow and expensive.While blockchain cannot yet take on billions of dollars of transactions in equities or currency markets handling thousands of deals per second, energy trades are not overly complex and occur at a rate of one every few seconds, offering a good fit.(GRAPHIC: Blockchain the key - http://tmsnrt.rs/2G9UJDe)Some in a fiercely competitive commodities sector are reluctant to put their data on a common platform, however, making progress slow going.Research firm IDC estimates global investment in blockchain will more than double in 2018 to $2.1 billion from $945 million last year, most of it for banking, but expects "strong, double-digit growth" in the energy space between 2016 and 2021.Germany's capital Berlin has become a thriving hub for start-ups looking at digital business models.Its European School of Management and Technology (ESMT) polled attendees of the city's annual blockchain in energy conference EventHorizon last year and said some 36 percent saw blockchain cutting utility process costs by almost a third.Another research firm, Trend Research of Bremen, has said more than 80 percent of energy companies it interviewed are planning or preparing blockchain processes, in decentralised energy production, electric mobility, retail sales, renewable power origin certificates, network management and billing.Merz said financial trading rules with high capital requirements did not apply to Enerchain, as it is defined as a communication channel for data exchanges.If successful, it could in theory allow the group to pool other professional resources such as risk management and compliance reporting.Christoph Burger, senior lecturer at ESMT, said Enerchain looked well placed to avoid the lack of trust issues that have caused other attempts to use blockchain to founder."This is a nicely focused and well functioning use case ... and legal questions are easily resolved," he said.MASS MARKET HURDLESNew infrastructure is needed and new regulation and industry standards must be embedded before blockchain can transform existing mass market processes, experts say."A public blockchain may involve everyone seeing the movements around my account, if my smart metre is hooked up to the network," said Ewald Hesse, chief executive and co-founder of Grid Singularity, an energy data exchange platform hosted by the non-profit Energy Web Foundation (WEF)."It can't be that everyone who is able to code knows what is happening."It also must be clear who builds and maintains the systems. "Bear in mind that there might be job losses in areas such as controlling, legal, IT and administration," said ESMT's Burger.Start-ups are drawn to Germany, Europe's biggest and most highly priced power market and home to 1.6 million small renewable power production units and over 80 million consumers."Things are really going to take off here in the future," said E.ON's chief executive Johannes Teyssen of solar markets, where rising sales of inexpensive batteries could allow millions of prosumers to enter the scene.Solar panels owners dream of neighbourhood power-sharing schemes and of owning electric cars, helped by the roll out of 5G mobile data network services enabling "smart" home applications.They have been encouraged by sellers of the panels, which will start gradually losing 20-year fixed term subsidies in the next few years, who gloss over the fact that the smart meters needed to enable such schemes are years from being rolled out.(Additional research by Alissa de Carbonnel; editing by Philippa Fletcher)MOSCOW —  Sergei Mavrodi, a Russian operator of Ponzi schemes and sometime politician, has died. He was 62.Mavrodi shot to fame in Russia's chaotic and poverty-stricken 1990s, promising vast profits to investors in his MMM schemes, many of whom lost their savings when the pyramid schemes collapsed.At the height of his fame he was a TV personality and was elected a member of parliament in 1994, which gave him immunity from prosecution. He later served a four-year prison term for fraud, but was only ordered to pay back a fraction of the sums invested in his schemes.Russian state news agencies say Mavrodi died in a Moscow hospital. The precise circumstances weren't immediately clear.According to his Twitter account, Mavrodi had recently launched a "marketing system" using blockchain technology.TEL AVIV —  Israeli social investment platform eToro said it raised $100 million in private financing, bringing total funds raised to $162 million.The investment round was led by China Minsheng Financial, with SBI Group, Korea Investment Partners and others participating. The money was raised at a company valuation of $800 million.The company said it will use the funds to expand into new markets as well as continue its blockchain research and the development of digital assets.It completed its capital raising with the support of the London Stock Exchange Group’s private placement platform.The company said growth has been driven, in part, by demand for investments in the cryptocurrency market.Founded in 2007, eToro has over 9 million users who can manually invest in over 1,500 instruments while those who lack time or experience can automatically copy the trades of other traders on the platform.(Reporting by Tova Cohen; Editing by Steven Scheer)ALMATY —  Kazakhstan's central bank has launched a blockchain-based mobile securities trading application which it hopes will allow locals to become more involved in the capital markets by simplifying access to it.The oil-rich Central Asian nation's stock and bond markets are dominated by a handful of institutional investors, with only 109,000 retail investor accounts in the nation of 18 million.The Astana government hopes to change that by selling stakes in some of the biggest state-controlled companies on the local market, and the central bank said in a statement this week its "Invest Online" app could be used for buying such stocks.At the moment though, app users can only buy the central bank's own one-year discount notes denominated in the local tenge currency and yielding 8.5 percent. Tenge deposits at local banks offer returns of 10 to 14 percent.Within a day after launch, the central bank has sold about $2,300 in notes, it said on Wednesday, and some 200 people registered as application users.(Reporting by Mariya Gordeyeva; Writing by Olzhas Auyezov; Editing by Peter Graff and Louise Heavens)KAMPALA, Uganda —  In a sleek new high-rise in Uganda's capital, an enthusiastic lecturer described his financial success with the cryptocurrency bitcoin while his earnings were projected on a screen."What I have earned in one-and-a-half years from bitcoin is more than I earned in 10 years as a teacher," Richard M. Bagorogo told his audience. "I am living on bitcoin because getting a job in this country is not easy."Some tech-savvy Africans are embracing bitcoin, the most popular virtual currency, despite the warnings of a few governments, seeing the volatility in its value a better risk than the usual hustle amid the continent's high unemployment.Many bitcoin adoptees are professionals aiming to supplement their salaries, but others are jobless millennials hoping to make a living by trading the cryptocurrency, which isn't tied to any bank or government and, like cash, allows users to spend and receive money anonymously or mostly so.In Kampala, Uganda's capital, and elsewhere a small community turns up at events where stars like Bagorogo preach what they call "the gospel of bitcoin."On a recent morning Bagorogo explained how he once could not afford to enroll his children in the international school where he taught. Now, he said, his lifestyle has changed: a recent holiday in Dubai and more than enough money to help out his father.It didn't always go smoothly, as many in Africa have little idea what bitcoin is."When I tried to bring my cousins on board, they called my father in the village and said, 'Your son has gone mad,'" Bagorogo recalled. "For me, I was fascinated by the mathematics behind blockchain technology. But the local man is interested in money, not the mathematics, so I normally sit with them and show them how I get and withdraw my money. Once they see how easy it is, they also want bitcoin."Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies rely on blockchain, or the public, distributed ledgers that track the coins' ownership. The bitcoin ledger is powered by "miners," so-called because they throw computational power into the system to discover and verify cryptocurrency units, occasionally receiving — or "mining" — new bitcoins in return.Bagorogo encourages people to invest in one of over two dozen global mining pools. For many who can't afford to buy and hoard large amounts, the potential returns, including dividends, can seem promising.Such facilities, however, have faced doubts about whether they are genuine and some countries have warned of money laundering and the threat to government-backed currencies.In China, where a substantial amount of the world's supply of bitcoin originates, the government ordered a shutdown of all cryptocurrency mining operations in January. The crackdown, plus hacking attacks leading to the theft of hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of bitcoin from Japanese transfer Coincheck, contributed to the volatility of the value of a single unit of bitcoin, which rose to $19,000 in December but has since fallen below $9,000.Uganda's central bank has warned that investing in bitcoin and other digital currencies "is taking a risk in the financial space where there is neither investor protection nor regulatory purview."Kenya and Nigeria have issued similar concerns, and last year Namibia officially banned the use of cryptocurrencies for commercial purposes. But other countries in Africa appear open to the possibilities. Last year Tunisia announced it would launch a digital currency based on blockchain technology and South Africa, Africa's most developed economy, is researching the technology's feasibility.Despite the risks, "it is not wise to dismiss cryptocurrencies at this stage," said Stephen Kaboyo, a Ugandan analyst who runs the Kampala-based financial services firm Alpha Capital Partners. But those who invest in "a hugely speculative asset" must first understand the risks, he warned.In Uganda, where per capita income was less than $700 in 2016, bitcoin enthusiasts are mostly unfazed by the volatility. At least one restaurant in Kampala now accepts bitcoin, with owner Jennifer Birungi saying she had to put it "on the menu" to get more comfortable with cryptocurrencies.Birungi is a registered user of the exchange platform BitPesa, which serves 6,000 customers in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and Nigeria. They can cash out their bitcoin in return for local currency, which can be sent directly to their mobile phones' bitcoin wallets or wired to their bank accounts.Other enthusiasts cited the relative convenience of bitcoin in financial transfers."I used to want to buy medical equipment online but it was becoming hard. Transacting online is very expensive in Uganda with all the fees," said Moses Semulya, a doctor at a Kampala hospital. "Bitcoin is changing that, making things easier and faster."Semulya said he rues a missed opportunity to invest in bitcoin in 2016 when it was still relatively cheap. Now he holds nearly $800 worth of it in his digital wallet, an amount he hopes will swell as more people in Africa and elsewhere turn to the cryptocurrency.He concluded: "Right now I would rather invest in bitcoin and watch this space rather than buying a plot of land."TOKYO —  Japan's financial watchdog on Friday issued a warning to Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange Binance for operating without registration, the latest move by regulators to tighten standards in the country's digital money industry.The Financial Services Agency (FSA) said in statement that it had issued the warning to Binance, one of the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, for engaging in business with Japanese residents via the internet despite lacking permission to do so.The regulator said Binance likely allowed Japanese residents to open accounts without confirming their identities, adding that the exchange would face criminal charges if it continued to do business without a license.An FSA official told Reuters it had not given the exchange any particular deadline to cease its operations.Binance Chief Executive Changpeng Zhao said on Twitter the exchange was told of the warning on Friday morning, and was engaging with the watchdog."Our lawyers called JFSA immediately, and will find a solution," he wrote, referring to the regulator. "Protecting user interests is our top priority."Binance did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment.Last year, Japan became the first country in the world to regulate the cryptocurrency industry, requiring all exchanges to register with the authorities in an effort to bolster consumer protection and clamp down on illegal uses of digital money.The warning against the Hong Kong exchange marked further steps by the FSA to shore up consumer protection in the wake of the $530 million theft of digital money from Tokyo-based Coincheck Inc in January.In February, it issued a warning to Macau-based Blockchain Laboratory for operating without registration.The watchdog also recently punished seven cryptocurrency exchanges already registered or awaiting registration over issues ranging from lax security to poor controls on money laundering.(Reporting by Thomas Wilson and Takahiko Wada; Editing by Himani Sarkar)
